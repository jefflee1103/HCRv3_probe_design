# Probe Selection Algorithm: A Dynamic Programming Approach

## 1\. The Challenge: Selecting an Optimal Probe Set

The design of a high-quality Hybridization Chain Reaction (HCR) probe set requires selecting multiple short oligonucleotide probes that bind contiguously to a target RNA molecule. After an initial screening process that filters candidate probes based on thermodynamic stability (e.g., melting temperature, Gibbs free energy) and sequence specificity (e.g., BLAST screening), a crucial challenge remains: from a pool of potentially overlapping candidates, how do we select the *best* final set?

The "best" set must satisfy two criteria, which we define in a hierarchical manner:

1. **Primary Objective: Maximize Coverage.** The primary goal is to select the maximum possible number of non-overlapping probes that can fit within a given region of the target transcript. A higher number of probes generally leads to a stronger and more robust fluorescence signal.  
2. **Secondary Objective: Maximize Quality.** Among all possible combinations that contain the maximum number of probes, the secondary goal is to select the specific combination that is most thermodynamically favorable. We quantify this by selecting the set with the minimum possible sum of dG deviations from an ideal target value.

A naïve approach, such as testing every possible combination of probes, is computationally infeasible as the number of combinations grows exponentially. To solve this problem efficiently and guarantee an optimal result, this application employs a powerful technique from computer science known as **dynamic programming**.

## 2\. The Solution: Dynamic Programming & Weighted Interval Scheduling

Our probe selection problem is a variant of a classic computer science problem known as **Weighted Interval Scheduling** (Kleinberg & Tardos, 2005). We can represent each candidate probe as an "interval" on the transcript (defined by its start and end coordinates) with an associated "weight" or "score" (derived from its dG deviation).

Dynamic programming solves complex problems by breaking them down into a collection of simpler, overlapping subproblems. The solution to each subproblem is stored so it can be reused, avoiding redundant calculations.

The algorithm proceeds in four main stages:

### Stage 1: Sorting

First, all candidate probes within a contiguous block are sorted based on their genomic end coordinate. This ordering is critical, as it allows the algorithm to process probes sequentially along the transcript.

### Stage 2: Predecessor Calculation

For each probe i, the algorithm identifies p(i), which is the right-most probe in the sorted list that *does not overlap* with probe i (respecting the user-defined spacing). This pre-calculation step is essential for the efficiency of the main loop.

### Stage 3: The Dynamic Programming Table

The core of the algorithm is the construction of a table (referred to as the DP table) that stores the optimal solution for increasingly larger sets of probes. Starting with an empty set, the algorithm considers each probe i one by one and makes a decision:

* **Should we include probe i in our solution?**

To answer this, we compare two potential outcomes based on our hierarchical objectives:

1. **The solution *with* probe i**: This consists of probe i itself, plus the optimal solution found for its non-overlapping predecessors (which we already calculated and stored at position p(i) in our DP table).  
2. **The solution *without* probe i**: This is simply the best solution found for the set of probes ending at i-1, which is already stored in our DP table.

The algorithm compares these two outcomes using **lexicographical comparison**: it first compares the number\_of\_probes. The solution with more probes is always chosen. If, and only if, the number of probes is equal, it then compares the score. The solution with the better score is chosen. The winning outcome is stored as the optimal solution for the set of probes up to i.

### Stage 4: Backtracking

After the DP table is complete, the entry for the final probe contains the details of the optimal solution for the entire set (i.e., the maximum number of probes and the best possible score). The algorithm then backtracks through the decisions stored in the table to reconstruct the specific set of probes that constitutes this optimal solution.

## 3\. A Visual Example

Let's walk through the process with a small, illustrative example. Assume we have six candidate probes (A-F) in a region.

* **Goal**: Maximize probe count, then maximize score.  
* **Score**: For simplicity, let's use score \= 200 \- dG\_deviation.  
* **Probe Spacing**: 2 nucleotides.

| Probe | Start | End | dG\_dev | Score | p(i) \- Predecessor |  
| A | 1 | 10 | 15 | 185 | 0 (None) |  
| B | 12 | 20 | 10 | 190 | 1 (Probe A) |  
| C | 18 | 25 | 12 | 188 | 1 (Probe A) |  
| D | 22 | 30 | 8 | 192 | 2 (Probe B) |  
| E | 28 | 35 | 14 | 186 | 3 (Probe C) |  
| F | 33 | 40 | 9 | 191 | 4 (Probe D) |  
The algorithm builds the DP table, making a decision at each step:

| Considering | Decision | Reason for Decision | Optimal Solution Found |  
| Probe A | Include A | (1, 185\) is better than (0, 0). | {A} \-\> (1 probe, score 185\) |  
| Probe B | Include B | B \+ sol(A) gives (2, 375). This has more probes than {A} \-\> (1, 185). | {A, B} \-\> (2 probes, score 375\) |  
| Probe C | Exclude C | C \+ sol(A) gives (2, 373). This has the same \# of probes as {A, B} but a lower score (373 vs 375). | {A, B} \-\> (2 probes, score 375\) |  
| Probe D | Include D | D \+ sol(B) gives (3, 567). This has more probes than {A, B} \-\> (2, 375). | {A, B, D} \-\> (3 probes, score 567\) |  
| Probe E | Exclude E | E \+ sol(C) gives (3, 559). This has the same \# of probes as {A, B, D} but a lower score. | {A, B, D} \-\> (3 probes, score 567\) |  
| Probe F | Include F | F \+ sol(D) gives (4, 758). This has more probes than {A, B, D} \-\> (3, 567). | {A, B, D, F} \-\> (4 probes, score 758\) |

#### Final Result

By systematically building this table, the algorithm determines that the optimal set is **{A, B, D, F}**. This set contains the maximum possible number of probes (4), and of all possible 4-probe combinations, this specific one has the highest possible quality score.
